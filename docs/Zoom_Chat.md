## Create a .env File

Using the .env.example file as a template, create a .env file.

⚠️ DO NOT DELETE THE .env.example FILE!
.env.example is used by env-cmd to verify that the .env file is correctly configured.

=   =   =   =   =   =   =   =   =   =

## Where to get the Subdomain, View ID, and App ID?

Go to your Kintone App's custom view & grab the URL
Kintone App's URL follows this template:
https://<SUBDOMAIN>.kintone.com/k/<App ID>/
Example:

https://example.kintone.com/k/1/
Subdomain = example
KINTONE_BASE_URL = https://example.kintone.com
App ID = 1

=   =   =   =   =   =   =   =   =   =

Direct Message with your email address if you forgot your Kintone Subdomain

=   =   =   =   =   =   =   =   =   =

The KINTONE_BASE_URL variable is based on your subdomain.

For example:
Subdomain = example
KINTONE_BASE_URL = https://example.kintone.com

=   =   =   =   =   =   =   =   =   =
